This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Just run `npm install`, then `npm start` (or `yarn` and `yarn start`! ðŸ˜º) and the app will run at http://localhost:3000.

`master` has some extra functionality beyond the challenge- the `challenge-complete` tag points to the version that just fulfills the requirements.
